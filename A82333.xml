         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving once by the bleſſing of God upon our endeavours diſſipated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced moſt part of the adverſe Party that but lately were both ſtrong and prevalent in the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yet whilſt wee have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied abroad (fighting with the Common Enemy) a new Party have combined together, both in the City and Parliament (not only to fruſtrate all that hath been already acted by us with inceſſant labours, to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and loſſe of our lives and eſtates) but have made uſe of their power to obſtruct and prevent Juſtice, to injure, oppreſſe, and cruſh the peaceable and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected people of the Kingdome, to abridge and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all juſt freedome and liberty, and to drive on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to ſet up that Party at home, which wee are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe abroad; the ready way not onely to caſt an Odium upon all wee have done hitherto, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave both us and the whole Kingdome to all Poſterity hereafter.</p>
            <p>Wee therefore being very ſenſible of a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Party in the City of London, that have not onely to ſtrengthen themſelves, and their pernitious deſignes, cloſed with a deſperate and Malignant Party; but ſought to new moddell the Common-Counſell, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162258:3"/>to get the power of the Militia into their owne hands, have ſtirred up the poore abuſed people to ſet their hands to, and Petition for they know not what, under the notion of a Perſonall Treaty; and by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, violent, and preſſing importunity at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doores, have forced them not onely to revoke their former Votes, but to recall their Declarations, concerning of making no more Addreſſes to the King; becauſe guilty not only of all the innocent blood that hath been ſhed, but hath alſo remained obſtinate, even for all he hath loſt all, and is in no condition and power to raiſe or helpe himſelfe; yet even at that time, when our Conqueſt is neere compleat, to ſue to, and make Addreſſes too, and Treat with Him that wee have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſubdued; making our ſelves guilty of our own Acts, and of intailing innocent blood, and ſlavery upon us and our children for ever heereafter, making our ſelves guilty of thoſe crimes wee fight againſt; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Tyranny, Perſecution, and the like.</p>
            <p>But Treat they will, that is their pretence; but their intent ſeemes to be no other then to make uſe of many ignorant, giddy-brained, and idolatrous people, to throng in Multitudes to him, and ſo overpower them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs; yea, and the whole Kingdome with their weight and levity. Doth not Nature and Reaſon, therefore teach us to prevent the miſchiefes that are comming upon us, as well as to ſecure our ſelves? And how can it be but by diſſipation of them at the firſt, before they have bodied, or grow numerous? The Nature and Malignity of their Petition for a Treaty, ſhewes the Nature and compoſition of the Leaders that lead the ſame, whoſe glittering pretences are not gold,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162258:3"/>but lead gilded over; their words, expreſſions, and poſtures, ſhewing the intended ruine and poſtration both of us, and all wee have ſo long, and ſo ſuccesfully achieved; yet ſo mad they are, that this they will doe, though wee are aſſured they will by theſe courſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves and their owne in the concluſion: Who offends them ſo, as ſuch offenſive defence needs to be? Doth not their arming inforce arming? Doth not their univerſall violence, as they will have the King home right or wrong, import them virulent? and what can be preſaged from ſuch depravids, but prabities? Much more might be inferred from the contence of their diſcontented Petition for a Treaty; ſo from the Leaders, and the lead; ſo from their words, expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and poſtures; but comprehenſive underſtandings will ſave us a labour, and incomprehenſive and willfull ones, will make us a labour.</p>
            <p>Therefore for divers weighty Reaſons, and to hold you no longer in ſuſpenſe: Wee doe now declare to all people our Reſolutions and Intentions:</p>
            <p>That wee cannot comply with any in their prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous pretended Treaty with the King, intending ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with him, to enſlave our ſelves and our Poſterities, and the whole Kingdome, before theſe Particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing be aſcertained us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they make good the Supreame of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from all pretences of Negative Voices, whether it be in King or Lords, or any that ſhall lay challenge to claime any ſuch Titles.</p>

            <p n="8">8. That none bee examined againſt themſelves, or punniſhed for doing that againſt which no Law is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
